# G-Croc
G-Croc (Short for Garnet Croc) is a Croc GUI I developed in Python for the instructionally impared. 

I will be honest, aside from bursts of inspiration, this will probably never be updated unless I feel like it

# Requirements:
Croc (if you are using windows, you will need to install winget first, then install croc)
If you are on Linux, take a the .py script, if you're on windows, take the .exe

# To Do List:
- Package the .exe with croc included
- Make it look better
- Download install location selector
